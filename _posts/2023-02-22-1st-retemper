# Retemper mini chocolate bars in batch

Chocolate bars I received from chocolate tasting course 
were melted during the shipment. 
Usually, I would just eat the untempered chocolate bars. 
Not as delicious as tempered one, yet I understand those 
little while dots has no hard to health. 
However, these particular chocolate bars are for tasting 
purpose, I need a way to fix this to have a better tasting experience. 
The difficulty part is that there are about 30 mini chocolate bars. 
If I put one chocolate bar in the bowl to do a bowl temper, most of chocolate 
would probably stick to the surface of bowl. 

Even if I manage to temper and collect a small part of chocolate, 
I donâ€™t want to repeat this process 30 times. 
I need to find a way to temper these chocolate bars in the original plastic bag.
